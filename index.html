        Dave Meneses was born in Chicago on September 10, 1990. He grew up in
        the city and the suburbs and eventually went to college in Deerfield, IL
        where he graduated with a degrees in Humanities and Secondary Education.
        After school, he had brief stints as a middle school teacher and a
        professional fundraiser before he left the world of education and
        started working in the service industry. <br /><br />Coming from a
        unique background, he was able to use his education experience to become
        a trainer in the beverage world and helped coached competitors at the
        highest level of coffee competition. Bouncing back and forth between
        Chicago and LA, he worked with some of the most respected coffee brands
        and grew his role to be the Midwest Area Manager for Stumptown Coffee.
        <br /><br />His hobbies include many physically taxing sports including
        skateboarding, rugby, and jiu jitsu. Unfortunately, it was that love for
        the extreme that caused him to have a serious injury, tearing both a
        tendon and a ligament in his ankle. Luckily, during his extended time
        off he was able to rediscover his love for an old hobby of his, coding.
        Because his recovery time was estimated to take over a year he decided
        it was time for a change and signed up for Northwestern’s Coding
        Bootcamp where he is learning to turn his old hobby into a profession.
